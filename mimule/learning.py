"""Adaptive learning engine for the mimule fuzzer.

Houses the MutatorScoreTracker, which evaluates the effectiveness of
mutation strategies and individual transformers over time. Scores are
incremented on each successful discovery and decayed periodically based
on attempt count (every DECAY_INTERVAL attempts), so that recently
successful mutators are favored while inactive ones gradually lose weight.

Selection uses an epsilon-greedy policy: with probability epsilon the
fuzzer explores uniformly, otherwise it exploits the learned weights.
A grace period (min_attempts) ensures new or rarely-used candidates
receive a neutral baseline weight until enough data is collected.

Port note: verbatim from lafleur/learning.py aside from the import path
and docstring updates. The epsilon-greedy algorithm is language-agnostic
and needs no Monkey-specific adaptation.
